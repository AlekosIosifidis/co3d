# Dataset Preparation

### Kinetics
[Kinetics](https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/kinetics) is a large-scale dataset for Trimmed Human Activity Recognition, consisting of 10 second videos collected from YouTube, ranging over 400 classes.
Due to it's origin, a direct download of the complete dataset is not possible.
Instead, a list of videos and corresponding labels can be downloaded [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/Datasets/kinetics400.tar.gz), and a [YouTube Crawler](https://github.com/LukasHedegaard/youtube-dataset-downloader) can subsequently be employed to collect the videos one by one. Note: this process may take multiple days.
